  For the time being, you can play WebM files (which are VP8 for video and
  Vorbis for audio, enclosed in a Matroska container) with gst123, which
  was just uploaded to Debian.
  
  Other gstreamer-based players should support those files right away, as
  long as you have gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad version at least 0.10.18.3-2
  installed.
  
  Videos in those formats, where available, are taken automatically with
  the use of the '-b' switch or with the specification of formats 43 (for
  360p videos) or 45 (for 720p videos).
