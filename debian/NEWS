youtube-dl (2010.07.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The upstream author has removed support for the -b ("best format") and
  the -d ("high def") command line options.
  
  The behavior now is to download the best quality for each video.
  If you experience a problem with youtube-dl downloading videos that are
  too large, you should consider using the --max-quality option to limit
  which format to use.
  
  The list of formats (in decreasing quality) can be found with:
  
      grep "available_formats =" /usr/bin/youtube-dl
